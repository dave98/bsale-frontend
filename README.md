  <p align="center">Built with Vanilla Javascript</p>

## Description

BSale FrontEnd is a pure vanillajs application developed with the help of external libraries like [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/).

## Installation 

Since this project was not developed with a particular framework, _npm_ _install_ won't work.

The easiest way to deploy this project is with [VisualStudioCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once installed go to extension section and search for [LiveServer]() (Installation wonÂ´t be a problem, just go to the install button). After that you should open _index_._html_ file and with the right mouse click find "Open with Live Server" option in the dropdown menu. Your browser will open and you will be able  to interact with the application.

## Interaction

By the moment, there are two possible ways to interact with the application. Go for the search button and type something. The application will sent a request to the backend system in order to find products with a name similar to what you wrote. The second interaction works with the category bar  located at the "Available Products" section. Just press a category and the system will send a new request to get all products in that category.
